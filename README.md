# ⏰ Neumorphic Slider Clock

A stylish, interactive digital clock built with **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 

This project features a smooth vertical sliding animation for the time changes and a **Dynamic Theme System** that automatically changes the color palette based on the time of day.
## ✨ Features

* **Neumorphic Design:** Soft UI shadows and rounded corners giving a realistic 3D feel.
* **Vertical Slider Animation:** Numbers slide vertically into place rather than just switching instantly.
* **Dynamic Theming:** The background, shadows, and text colors change automatically:
    * 🌅 **Morning (6AM - 10AM):** Soft Pink & Reddish Orange.
    * ☀️ **Day (10AM - 4PM):** Clean White & Soft Blue (Original Design).
    * 🌇 **Sunset (4PM - 7PM):** Warm Yellow & Orange.
    * 🌃 **Night (7PM - 6AM):** Deep Blue & Dark Mode with Neon accents.
* **Active State Highlighting:** The current time is permanently highlighted with a "pop" effect (scaled up and colored).
* **Pure Vanilla:** No frameworks or libraries required.
